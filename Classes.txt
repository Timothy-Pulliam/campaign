== Key Ability ==
This is the ability score that you’ll use to deterPmine the
Difficulty Class (DC) associated with your character’s
class features or feats. This is called your class DC. If
your character is of a spellcasting class, this key ability is
also used to calculate spell DCs and similar values. Most
classes are associated with one key ability score, but some
require you to choose from two options.
Additionally, when you choose your character’s class,
she gains an ability boost in her key ability. For more about
ability boosts, see page 43.
