==== Checks / Difficulty Class (DC) ====

Nonspellcasters use their class DC as the DC for many of their class features.

calculate DC
DC = 10 + mods

Critically succeed check
d20 + mods >= DC or d20 == 20

Critically Fail check
d20 + mods <= DC or d20 == 1

== Hero Points ==
Your character usually begins each game session with
1 Hero Point, and can gain additional Hero Points
throughout the course of the game for undertaking helpful
tasks for the group or performing heroic deeds during her
adventures. Your character can use Hero Points to gain
certain benefits, such as staving off death, rerolling a d20,
and the like. See page 300 for more about Hero Points.

== AC / TAC ==
AC (Armor Class) = how hard it is to hit a target
TAC (Touch Armor Class) = how hard it is to touch a target

Spells or abilities that give your character a bonus or
penalty to AC also give an equal bonus or penalty to TAC
unless stated otherwise.
