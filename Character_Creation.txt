GENERATING ABILITY SCORES
When you’re ready to calculate your character’s ability
scores, follow the steps below. 

Your character’s ability
scores each start at 10, and then you’ll apply the ability
boosts and flaw she receives from her ancestry, background,
and class, plus four free ability boosts she receives at 1st
level. This process allows you to customize your character.

== Ability Boosts ==
if ability < 18:
  ability boost = 2
elif ability >= 18:
  ability boost = 1

At 1st level, a character can never
have any ability score that’s higher than 18.

You also cannot apply multiple ability boosts to the same ability at the same time. However, you can use an ability boost to cancel the effects of an ability flaw.

== Ability Flaws ==
The opposite of an ability boost. decrease an ability by 2 points.
